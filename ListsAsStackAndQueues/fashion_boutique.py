# You own a fashion boutique, and you receive a delivery of a huge box of clothes, represented as a sequence of
# integers. On the next line, you will be given an integer representing the capacity for one rack in your store.
# You must arrange the clothes in the store, and you use the racks to hang up every piece of clothing. You start
# from the last piece of clothing on the top of the pile to the first one at the bottom. Use a stack for the purpose.
# Each piece of clothing has its value (an integer). You must sum their values, while you take them out of the box.
# If the sum becomes equal to the capacity of the current rack you must take a new one for the next clothes,
# if there are any left in the box. If the sum becomes greater than the capacity, do not hang the piece of clothing
# to the current rack. Take a new rack and then hang up the piece of clothing. In the end, print how many racks you
# have used to hang up the clothes.
# Input
# •	On the first line you will be given a sequence of integers, representing the clothes in the box, separated by
# a single space.
# •	On the second line, you will be given an integer, representing the capacity of a rack.
# Output
# •	Print the number of racks, needed to hang up the clothes from the box.
# Constraints
# •	The values of the clothes will be integers in the range [0,20]
# •	There will never be more than 50 clothes in a box
# •	The capacity will be an integer in the range [0,20]
# •	None of the integers from the box will be greater than then the value of the capacity
